**Best Solution to the following assignment problem given to the undergraduate 
students of ECE department for the fullfillment of the course on "Optical Communications"**

## Problem Definition
SMF PROBLEM:
GIVEN
Three products for SMF (single mode fiber) transmission at a wavelength;
* 1.3 micro-meter= 1300nm
* 1.5 micro-meter= 1500nm
* Both 1.3 and 1.5 micro-meter
Create design curve that co-relate the core diameter, d to the fractional index change, delta.
Consider the silica fiber core (n=1.46) and then
a) Design for a step-index profile
b) Design for a quadratic graded profile (p=2)
c) Finally show the variation of NA (numerical aperture) with the acceptance angle with your choices
