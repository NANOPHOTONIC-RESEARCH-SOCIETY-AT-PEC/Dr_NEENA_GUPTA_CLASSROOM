# CASE STUDY ON ROLE OF AI in MODERN OPTICS

We live in an era of information explosion and digital revolution that has resulted in rapid
technological developments in different aspects of life. Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an
increasingly important role in this digital transformation. AI applications require edge cloud computing
with low latency connections, where the significant challenge is that it needs a lot of computer processing
power. Recently, the implementation of AI based on optics hardware has become a popular topic
due to its fundamentally lower power consumption and faster computation

On the other hand, as the underlying basis of modern tele- and data-communications,
optical networking becomes more and more complex, driven by more data and more connections.
Generating, transmitting, and recovering such high-volume data requires advanced signal processing
and networking technologies with high performance and cost-and-power efficiency. AI is especially
useful for optimization and performance prediction for systems that exhibit complex behaviors.

In this aspect, traditional signal processing algorithms may not be as efficient as AI algorithms.
AI methods have recently entered the field of optics, ranging from quantum mechanics to nanophotonic,
optical communication, and optical networks.

**This case study asks you to cover the 

progress in the combined area of **optics and AI**, 

ranging from photonic neural network (NN) architecture to AI-enabled advances in optical communications including both physical layer transceiver signal processing and network layer performance monitoring,
as well as the potential role of AI in quantum communications.

You are free to chose any of the topics mentioned below or any other topic if not mentioned here that must review the essence of **AI in Optics**

1. Photonic neural network architecture

2. AI for short-reach optical communications

3. AI for medium- and long-reach optical communications

4. AI for optical performance monitoring

5. AI for quantum communications
