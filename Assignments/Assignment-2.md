1.   * Among microwaves and light waves which have high bit rate distance product. Why?

2.   * Elucidate the reasons for nonlinearity in optical fibers?

3.   * Can electricity be transmitted through optical fibers, justify?

4.   * How graded index fiber minimizes intermodal dispersion. Is graded index better than step index fiber? How?

5.   * Write the expression for the refractive index in graded index fibers.

6.   * Give physical interpretation of negative waveguide dispersion?

7.   * Mention any two materials system used in the fabrication of optical fibers. Explain the vapor-phase deposition techniques to produce silica rich glasses of          highest transparency.
