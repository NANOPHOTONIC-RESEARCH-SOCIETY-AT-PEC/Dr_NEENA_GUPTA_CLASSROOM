1.   * What is the best solution to couple VCSEL into SM fiber?
2.   * How can you reduce macrobending losses for optical communication system so that it can provide some solution for the designer?
3.   * Why bending losses are major losses in PCF?
4.   * How can you couple lasers into fiber with minimum losses?
5.   * Why laser diodes with narrow spectral width are recommended for light sources? Explain in terms of dispersion.
6.   * Discuss major structural problems with depressed cladding fibers.
7.   * Discuss the difference between optics as performed at wavelengths near 100 Armstrong  units with optics near 5000 Armstrong units, Specially contrast ;
     a)    * Use of lenses
     b)	   * Use of mirrors
