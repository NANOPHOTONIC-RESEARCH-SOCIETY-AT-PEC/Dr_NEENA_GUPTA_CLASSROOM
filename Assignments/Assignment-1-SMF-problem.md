# Assignment-1-SMF-Problem 

**GIVEN**

### Three products for SMF(single mode fiber) transmission at a wavelength;

-a-> 1.3 micro-meter

-b-> 1.5 micro-meter

-c-> Bothe 1.3 and 1.5 micro-meter

## Create design curve that co-relate the core diameter, d to the fractional index change, delta

### Case-1

Consider the sillica fiber core (n=1.46) and then 

a) design for a step-index profile

b) design for a quadratic graded profile (p=2)

c) Finally show the  variation of NA (numerical aperture) with the acceptance angle with your choices
